## üõ† Required for MVP

To have a functional MVP, the following features need to be implemented:

### High Priority (Essential)
1. **Ticket Creation Form** - Users need to create tickets
2. **Chat Interface** - Core messaging functionality
3. **Ticket Detail Page** - View individual tickets with chat
4. **Basic AI Integration** - At least ticket classification
5. **Agent Ticket Assignment** - Agents need to claim tickets

### Medium Priority (Important)
1. **Real-time Notifications** - Users need to know about updates
2. **File Upload** - Attachment support
3. **Agent Dashboard** - Specialized agent interface
4. **Ticket Status Updates** - Workflow management

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Advanced Analytics** - Detailed reporting
2. **Admin Panel** - System administration
3. **Advanced AI Features** - Response suggestions, sentiment analysis
4. **Advanced Search** - Global search functionality

## üöÄ Quick Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update with your Supabase and Gemini API credentials

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Run the SQL schema in `database/schema.sql` in Supabase
   - This creates all tables, indexes, and RLS policies

4. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test the Application**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`
   - Sign up as different user types (customer, agent, admin)
   - Test the dashboard and basic functionality

## üìù Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Next.js 14 App Router** - Modern React patterns with server components
- **Supabase for Backend** - Managed PostgreSQL with real-time and auth
- **TailwindCSS for Styling** - Utility-first CSS with custom design system
- **TypeScript Throughout** - Full type safety across the application
- **Custom Hooks Pattern** - Reusable data fetching and state management

### Code Quality
- **ESLint Configuration** - Code linting and formatting
- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Maximum type safety
- **Component Architecture** - Modular and reusable components
- **Error Handling** - Proper error boundaries and user feedback
- **Loading States** - Skeleton loaders and loading indicators

### Security Considerations
- **Row-Level Security** - Database-level security policies
- **Authentication Required** - Protected routes and API access
- **Input Validation** - Zod schema validation for forms
- **XSS Protection** - Sanitized user inputs and outputs

## üéØ Next Steps
